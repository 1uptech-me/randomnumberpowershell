# random_number_game
This is a random number guessing game for powershell, I created it for a school project and has sounds for winning and loosing, as well as small animations.

## Installation
Windows-download file and run as administrator. If windows does not allow you to run unsigned scripts you can use "set-executionpolicy remotesigned" in powershell.

Linux-you can download powershell from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-7.
